Inside a project you have two kinds of agents: quick agents handle short, focused tasks like answering questions, generating snippets, or running one-off commands. Durable agents are long-lived — they get their own branch and worktree, persist across sessions, and are designed for larger missions like building a feature end-to-end, performing multi-step refactors, or running test suites. You can have multiple durable agents active at once, each working independently.',

The agent makes all its changes on that copy, so your main project is never affected until you decide to merge. Merging means taking the agent\'s work and bringing it into your main project. You don\'t need to learn Git commands to use Clubhouse — the agents handle all of that for you. Just know that your code is always safe, and you\'re always in control of what gets merged.',

Agents can write code, create files, run tests, fix bugs, and open pull requests — all from your description. You review the result and decide whether to accept it. Think of agents as tireless collaborators: they don\'t get bored, they don\'t forget context, and they can work on multiple things at once. Start with small tasks to build confidence, then work your way up to larger missions.',

This means no more stashing work-in-progress, no branch-switching overhead, and no merge conflicts between agents. Each worktree has its own working directory and branch, so agents can write code, run builds, and execute tests in complete isolation. You can have multiple agents working in parallel on different features, bug fixes, or refactors without any of them interfering with each other or with your own work.',

Issues lets you track bugs, features, and tasks directly inside the app — create them manually or let agents file them as they discover problems. The Wiki gives you a place to document architecture decisions, onboarding guides, API references, and anything else your team needs to know. Automations let you set up triggers and actions that run automatically — for example, kick off an agent whenever a new issue is created, or run a test suite after every commit. All three integrate with your agents, so your project management and your coding environment are the same thing.',

There\'s no stashing, no branch switching, and no risk of agents stepping on each other\'s work. Agents operate fully independently: they write code, run tests, commit, and produce PRs in their isolated environments. You monitor everything from the hub and merge results when they\'re ready.',

You can scope an agent to read-only access for safe exploration, give another full write and deploy permissions for shipping, or restrict a third to only run tests. System prompts let you give each agent specific instructions — "focus only on the API layer," "follow our style guide," "never modify the database schema" — so they stay focused on their mission. This per-worktree configuration means you can run agents with very different trust levels and responsibilities side by side, all within the same project.',
