# Themes & Display

Clubhouse offers a selection of built-in themes that control the visual appearance of the entire application, including the editor interface and terminal colors. You can switch themes at any time from the Display settings.

## Changing Your Theme

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the Project Rail, or press `Cmd+,`).
2. Navigate to the **Display** section.
3. Select a theme from the list.

The new theme is applied immediately across the entire application. There is no need to restart Clubhouse.

## Available Themes

Clubhouse ships with eight built-in themes.

| Theme | Style | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Catppuccin Mocha** | Dark | A warm, pastel-toned dark theme. This is the default theme for new installations. |
| **Catppuccin Latte** | Light | The light counterpart to Catppuccin Mocha, with soft pastel tones on a light background. |
| **Solarized Dark** | Dark | Ethan Schoonover's precision-engineered color scheme, dark variant. Designed for long reading sessions with carefully balanced contrast. |
| **Terminal** | Dark | A classic green-on-black aesthetic inspired by vintage CRT terminals. |
| **Nord** | Dark | An arctic, north-bluish color palette with muted tones. Clean and minimal. |
| **Dracula** | Dark | A popular dark theme with vivid purples, pinks, and greens on a dark background. |
| **Tokyo Night** | Dark | Inspired by the vibrant lights of downtown Tokyo. Balanced contrast with cool blue tones. |
| **Gruvbox Dark** | Dark | A retro-inspired theme with warm, earthy tones of orange, yellow, and aqua on a dark background. |

## Terminal Color Integration

Each theme defines its own complete terminal color scheme. This includes:

- **16 ANSI colors** -- the standard set of 8 normal colors and 8 bright variants used by terminal applications, shell prompts, and syntax highlighting in CLI tools.
- **Cursor color** -- the color of the blinking cursor in terminal views.
- **Selection color** -- the background color used when you highlight text in the terminal.

When you switch themes, terminal colors update immediately in all open terminal sessions. This ensures a consistent visual experience between the Clubhouse interface and the terminal output from your agents.

## Home Dashboard Toggle

The Display settings also include a toggle to **show or hide the Home dashboard**.

- **Enabled (default)** -- Clicking the Home button in the Project Rail opens the Home dashboard, which shows an overview of all your projects and active agents.
- **Disabled** -- The Home dashboard is hidden. Clicking the Home button has no effect, and Clubhouse opens directly to the last active project on launch.

This is useful if you prefer a minimal workflow and do not need the overview screen.
