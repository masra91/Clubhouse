# Navigation

Clubhouse uses a multi-pane layout to organize your workspace.

## Project Rail

The leftmost column (60px) is the **Project Rail**. It contains:

- **Home** button — returns to the dashboard
- **Project icons** — click to switch between projects
- **Add project** (`+`) — opens a folder picker
- **Help** (`?`) — opens this help system
- **Settings** (gear) — opens the settings panel

Projects can be reordered by dragging and dropping in the rail.

## Explorer Rail

The second column shows context-specific navigation:

- **Agents** tab — lists all agents for the active project
- **Plugin tabs** — project-scoped plugins appear here

## Accessory Panel

The third column provides detail views:

- Agent configuration and status
- File browsers and Git information
- Plugin sidebar panels

## Main Content View

The largest pane on the right shows:

- Agent terminal output
- Plugin main panels
- Settings pages

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+,` | Open settings |
| `Cmd+1-9` | Switch between projects |
