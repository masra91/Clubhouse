            'Have voice conversations with your durable agents using push-to-talk.\n\n' +
            '### Getting Started\n' +
            '1. Open the **Voice** tab from the explorer rail\n' +
            '2. Select a sleeping durable agent from the sidebar\n' +
            '3. On first use, voice models will be downloaded (~200MB)\n' +
            '4. Hold the **Push to Talk** button and speak\n' +
            '5. Release to send — the agent will respond with synthesized speech\n\n' +
            '### Controls\n' +
            '| Action | Input |\n' +
            '|--------|-------|\n' +
            '| Push to talk | Hold **Space** or click and hold the mic button |\n' +
            '| Release to send | Release **Space** or mouse button |\n' +
            '| Interrupt playback | Start a new recording while agent is speaking |\n' +
            '| End session | Click **End** in the header bar |\n\n' +
            '### How It Works\n' +
            '- **Speech-to-text**: Your speech is transcribed locally using Whisper (no audio leaves your machine)\n' +
            '- **Agent interaction**: The transcribed text is sent to Claude in the agent\'s worktree context\n' +
            '- **Text-to-speech**: Responses are spoken back using Piper with a consistent voice per agent\n' +
            '- **Multi-turn**: Context is maintained across the entire conversation via `--resume`\n\n' +
            '### Agent Selection\n' +
            '- **Sleeping agents** are ready for voice immediately\n' +
            '- **Running agents** can be selected but their current session will be ended first (confirmation required)\n' +
            '- Each agent gets a consistent TTS voice based on its ID\n',
        },

            '### Microphone Access\n' +
            'Voice Chat requires microphone permission. If the browser blocks access:\n' +
            '- Check that Clubhouse has microphone permission in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone**\n' +
            '- Ensure no other application is exclusively using the microphone\n' +
            '- Try restarting the application after granting permission\n\n' +
            '### Model Download Issues\n' +
            '- Models are stored in `~/.clubhouse/voice-models/`\n' +
            '- Total download size is approximately 200MB (Whisper ~141MB, Piper voice ~75MB)\n' +
            '- If a download fails partway, retry — partial downloads are automatically cleaned up\n' +
            '- Check your internet connection if downloads stall\n\n' +
            '### No Audio Playback\n' +
            '- Verify your system audio output is working\n' +
            '- Check that the browser/app is not muted\n' +
            '- TTS runs at 22050Hz sample rate — ensure your audio device supports this\n\n' +
            '### Transcription Quality\n' +
            '- Whisper uses the `base.en` model — optimized for English\n' +
            '- Speak clearly and minimize background noise for best results\n' +
            '- Very short utterances (< 1 second) may not transcribe reliably\n',
